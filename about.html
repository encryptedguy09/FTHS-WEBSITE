      <h2>FTHS History</h2>

      <p>
        Founded by James T. Burns in 1925, Florentino Torres High School was originally named Legarda High School. 
        With only three teachers, Burns opened the school to students who were refused admission by the three existing public high schools in Manila.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1926, the school moved to the Sequoia Building at the foot of Pritil Bridge along Juan Luna Street and was renamed Manila West High School. 
        March 1928 marked the first group of students to graduate and the start of various school clubs and organizations.
      </p>

      <p>In 1930, under Principal Marcelino Bautista, the four Manila public high schools were renamed after Filipino Justices:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Manila West High School → Florentino Torres High School (Justice Florentino Torres)</li>
        <li>Manila North High School → Arellano High School (Justice Cayetano Arellano)</li>
        <li>Manila South High School → Araullo High School (Justice Manuel Araullo)</li>
        <li>Manila East High School → V. Mapa High School (Justice Victorino Mapa)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The first issue of <em>The Torres Torch</em>, the official school paper, was published in 1930. 
        In 1937, the school formally occupied the Constabulary Barracks in Gagalangin, its current location. 
        During World War II, operations ceased and all records were destroyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The school reopened on July 16, 1945, with Pablo Reyes as principal, and the first post-Liberation graduates received diplomas on November 24, 1945. 
        Foundation Day was first celebrated on October 16, 1953, under Mr. Cesario Bandong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the years, the school thrived under principals like Dr. Emiliano Rafael, Mr. Alfonso Asuncion, Mr. Rufino dela Cruz, and Dr. Dominador Wingsing. 
        In 1978, Mrs. Severa Saldana became the first female principal, improving library access, classrooms, and department buildings. 
        Subsequent principals included Dr. Consolacion Domingo, Dr. Florie Balanag, Ms. Adoracion Acuna, Mrs. Norma Escobar, and Mrs. Pilar Pizarro.
